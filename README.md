## Project description
E-comerce developed for DS first semester integrative project to demonstrate skills in Python, Java, HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The objective of the project was the construction of a virtual store containing different categories of products and each of the products has a specific page with a detailed description. 
This store should have a shopping cart where it is possible to add, increase the quantity, remove and finalize the purchase.

For analysis, a Python program would scrape the site and collect the name, description and price information of each of the products on the site and export this information to a .cvs file. And a java program would be responsible for reading this .csv file and presenting it in a well-organized way for the end user.
